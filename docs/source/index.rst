Welcome to Curie's documentation!
=================================

Curie is a python toolkit to aid in the analysis of experimental nuclear data.  

The primary application for Curie is activation analysis, with specific utilities developed for stacked-target, charged-particle activation analysis.
However, the convenient python interface to nuclear decay data and a range of cross section libraries makes Curie more generally useful in the nuclear sciences.

Curie features the following classes to aid in data analysis:

* Spectrum - Peak fitting for HPGe detector data.
* Calibration - Energy & efficiency calibration tool (for HPGe detectors).
* Ziegler - Stacked-target energy loss characterization.
* DecayChain - General purpose Bateman equation solver.
* Isotope - Isotopic and decay data.
* Reaction - Cross sections from multiple libraries.
* Library - Tool for searching and retrieving cross sections from multiple libraries.
